      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The <b>Global Positioning System (GPS)</b> is a satellite-based navigation
        network that enables anyone with a GPS receiver to determine their exact
        location and time anywhere on Earth. It was originally developed in the
        1970s by the <b>U.S. Department of Defense</b> for military operations
        and made available for civilian use in the 1980s. Today, GPS is an
        integral part of modern life, powering everything from Google Maps to
        aviation, shipping, agriculture, and even emergency services.
      </p>
      <p>
        GPS works independently of internet or mobile networks, making it
        especially useful in remote and rural areas. Combined with modern
        technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial
        intelligence, and 5G, GPS forms the foundation of intelligent navigation
        and location-based services worldwide.

    <!-- How GPS Works -->
    <section id="working" class="card">
      <h2>How GPS Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Satellite Constellation:</b> At least 24 active satellites orbit at
          an altitude of ~20,200 km. Each satellite constantly transmits its
          position and the current time using radio signals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Ground Control Segment:</b> Ground monitoring stations track
          satellites, correct orbital paths, and synchronize atomic clocks to
          ensure accuracy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>User Segment:</b> GPS receivers (in smartphones, cars, planes,
          ships) collect signals from at least four satellites. By measuring how
          long the signals take to arrive, the receiver calculates distance and
          determines precise <b>latitude, longitude, altitude,</b> and
          <b>time</b>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This process is called <b>trilateration</b>. Unlike triangulation (which
        uses angles), trilateration relies on distances to multiple satellites.
